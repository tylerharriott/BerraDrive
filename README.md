## Welcome to my personal IOS project

**Dilemma:**

At Montclair State University, there exist a Parking Garage in which many students use park. MSU is a mostly commuter based university. I realized that through out the eight floors of the parking garage, its easy to get lost. I also have faced the issue where, you are late to class and you are in such a rush you forget to take a mental note of where you parked. So I decided to create this IOS application to try and solve that issue. I proposed that every floor should have a QR code scanner with the current floor number and the zone you parked in. 

In the IOS app, the user would then scan the code to save where they parked. It takes almost milliseconds to scan and save, so no time is wasted.


* The application is very simple, but I am still proud of my creation. :grin:
